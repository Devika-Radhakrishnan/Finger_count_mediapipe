# Finger_count_mediapipe**
Hand Gesture Recognition with Mediapipe and OpenCV**
This project demonstrates real-time hand gesture recognition using the Mediapipe library and OpenCV in Python. It tracks hand landmarks and analyzes finger positions to accurately count the number of raised fingers.

Features:
Real-time Hand Tracking: Utilizes the Mediapipe library to detect and track hand landmarks in real-time from webcam video input.
Finger Counting: Analyzes the positions of hand landmarks to count the number of fingers raised by the user.
Visual Feedback: Provides visual feedback by overlaying hand landmarks and connections on the video stream and displaying the finger count on the screen.
User Interaction: Allows users to interact with the application through simple hand gestures, enabling intuitive control in various applications.

Requirements:
1.Python 3.x
2.Mediapipe
3.OpenCV

How to Use:
Install the required dependencies: pip install mediapipe opencv-python
Clone the repository: git clone (https://github.com/Devika-Radhakrishnan/Finger_count_mediapipe)
Navigate to the project directory: cd hand-gesture-recognition
Run the main script: python hand_gesture_recognition.py
Hold your hand in front of the webcam and observe the finger count displayed on the screen.

Future Improvements:
Implement more sophisticated gesture recognition algorithms for additional hand gestures.
Enhance the user interface with graphical overlays or interactive elements.
Optimize performance for real-time applications on resource-constrained devices.
